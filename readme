Some fiddling/meddling with IP addresses, using the IpToCountry.csv file
available from http://Software77.net. See http://software77.net/geo-ip/ for
more information.

Feel free to fiddle with the code too, but there is no guarantee it will work
correctly, or incorrectly or at all, for you.

The backing database was built using Postgresql on my system. The schema file
is available in the sql/schema file.

Unit tests using Bacon are in test/test_geo_ip.rb.

Use get_csv.sh to retrieve, and unzip, the IpToCountry.csv file and launch
add_geo_ip_to_db.rb. (Or not, again there is no guarantee any of this will work
for you.)
